        <div class="minisection"><h2><i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i></h2></div>
        <p><i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i> is the third movie in the Indiana Jones series. It was directed by Steven Spielberg and was released in 1989. The movie follows the archaelogist Indiana Jones as he and his father try to find the Holy Grail. This movie is one of my favorites due to it being the perfect adventure movie to me. I love the dynamic between Indy and his father, and the action and setpieces are so exciting and perfect. My dad showed me the <i>Indiana Jones</i> trilogy when I was a kid, and I hold that series close to my heart.</p>
        <div class="minisection"><h2><i>The Incredibles</i></h2></div>
        <p><i>The Incredibles</i> is an animated Pixar film that was directed by Brad Bird and released in 2004. It's about the former superhero Mr. Incredible and his superpowered family as they are forced out of their mundane lives and become heroes again. I love this movie because it's so well written. It plays the concept of outlawed superheroes so well, and the family aspect of the film is so realistic and interesting. I watched this movie all the time as a kid, and I've only grown to appreciate more as I've gotten older.</p>
        <div class="minisection"><h2><i>La La Land</i></h2></div>
        <p><i>La La Land</i> is a romantic musical that was directed by Damien Chazelle and released in 2016. The movie is about Mia, an actress struggling to get her big break and Sebastian, a pianist that dreams of starting his own jazz club. The two fall in love, but their paths seem to diverge as they come closer to realizing their dreams. This movie has some of the most dynamic cinematography I've ever seen in my life. Everything on the screen moves so well, and every frame during each musical section is filled with so much detail and care. It's an old school musical that's set in the modern day, and the beautiful musical sequences contrast so well with how realistically the plot goes. I grew up watching old musicals almost every Sunday with my grandma, so it's no wonder why I love this movie so much. </p>

            <li><p>I googled colors that went well together and saw that dark red and brown worked well together. I also found out myself that light pink also works well with brown</p></li>
