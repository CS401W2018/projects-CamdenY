        <h2>Link to an outside website with an absolute link.</h2>

        <h2>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h2>
        <p>An absolute link always starts with "https" and lead to other domains. Relative links lead within your own domain. The link should always start with the same domain name as the one you're using. Relative links are quicker to type and should make making our website faster when we use them instead of absolute links.</p>
        <h2>Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder).</h2>
        <a href="Engagement1-24.html">Engagement 1-24 </a>
        <h2>List the 3 rules with relative links.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the file name</li>
            <li>If you're linking to another folder inside the folder you're using inside your folder, use "/" to navigate between folders. Use ".." to go "up" a folder.</li>
            <li>If you want to navigate direcly to the root of the site, start your link with a "/"</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Link to your last project.</h2>
        <a href="../projects/CamdenÊ»sProfilePage.html">Camden's Profile Page</a>
        <h2>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h2>
        <p>No, links can go anywhere on the site.</p>
