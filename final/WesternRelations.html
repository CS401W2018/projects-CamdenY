        <h1>The First Contact</h1>
        <p>The first recorded European contact to the Hawaiian islands happened in 1779, when English explorer Captain Cook landed on Hawaiʻi island. He made contact with the native's there, who he saw as a thriving and healthy people. Cook described the Hawaiians as having a "keen, intelligent dispositon" and being "vigorous, active, and most active swimmers." While some estimate that the Hawaiian population at the time at was 200,000, others put the population at nearly 1,000,000.</p>

        <p>Although Captain Cook was killed after returning a second time to the islands, his ship's visit to Hawaiʻi changed everything. The biggest effect was smallpox from the British sailors, which soon infected the Native Hawaiian population, killing thousands. A less immediate effect was the influence the foreigners arrival had on a young chief from the island of Hawaiʻi named Kamehameha, who would soon begin a quest to unite all the islands of Hawaiʻi.</p>

        <p>Kamehameha's conquest in the Hawaiian islands became much easier with the assistance of two western advisors, John Young and Isaac Davis and the acquirement of muskets, gunpowder and cannons. By 1794, Kamehameha had fought his last battle on his quest, annhilating Oahu's chief mōʻi Kalanikūpule's forces with spears backed by gun and cannonfire. By 1810, Kauaʻi and Niʻihau were surrendered to Kamehameha, making him the first king over all the islands.</p>
        <h2>Liholiho: Ending the Kapu System and the Introduction of Christianity.</h2>
        <p>When Kamehameha I died in 1819, his highest ranking son Liholiho became ruler. Being the son of two extremely high ranking aliʻi (Kamehameha and Keōpulani), Liholiho's mana (or power) was even higher than that of his parents. Because of this, he was manipulated by the Kuhina Nui (regent) Kaʻahumanu and his mother Keōpulani to break the ʻai kapu, effectively ending the legitmacy of the Hawaiian religion. With the Hawaiian religion being broken, the conditions were perfect for a new religion to establish itself in the islands.</p>

        <p>Protestant missionaries soon arrived in 1820. The missionaries viewed the the Hawaiian people as profane and hedonestic. They believed it was their duty to save the Hawaiian people and westernize them. With the help of Kaʻahumanu, Christian laws were soon set in place that restricted much of native culture. Although many native Hawaiians accepted Christiananity due to it's promise of an afterlife in a time where thousands were dying, they needed to give up much of what made them who they were. Hawaiʻi had again changed, and many missionaries decided to stay in the islands and raise families. The descendants of these missionaries would eventually be catalysts for the Kingdom's downfall. </p>
        <h1>Kauʻikeouli: Western Influence and Threats</h1>

        <p>The next king, Kauʻikeouli was the longest reigning mōʻi of Hawaiʻi, ruling from 1824 to 1854. During his time as king, a lot of change came to Hawaiʻi's government, international relations and laws. One of the largest changes was the introduction of land ownership. Western businessmen wanted to own land, a concept foreign in Hawaiian culture. While aliʻi ruled over the makaʻainana, makaʻainana slept in under their protection and worked on the land. Hawaiians saw the relationship between kanaka and ʻāina as reciprocal: as long as we take care of them they will take care of us. No one really had the right to claim the land as theirs. The Māhele changed all of this.</p>
        <p>The Māhele was a division of land among the people of Hawaiʻi by Kauʻikeoli. The land was divided into three categories, Crown lands for the king, konohiki lands for aliʻi and makaʻainana lands for the common people. Although makaʻainana were allowed to claim the land within two years of the law taking effect, many simply did not understand the concept. These lands were eventually lost, and only 28,658 acres were claimed by makaʻainana, or less than 1% of the total lands in Hawaiʻi <a href="https://puke.ulukau.org/ulukau-books/?a=d&d=EBOOK-KS9.2.22.17&e=-------haw-20--1--txt-txPT-----------">(Cachola, 95).</a></p>

        <p>Throughout all of the Hawaiʻi's time as a nation, they all faced one massive issue. The population was decimated by foreign diseases, which tore through thousands of Native Hawaiians. By Liholiho's death in 1823, the population had shrunk to a fraction of it's previous pre-contact estimate. Even the nation's leaders were not safe, only 3 of them reigning for more than 10 years.</p>
