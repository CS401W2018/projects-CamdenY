        <h1>The Whisperings of Annexation</h1>
        <p>With Kalākaua advocating for a more independent Hawaiʻi and , there was a rumbling among the white population of Hawaiʻi. The descendants of the first missionaries that arrived in Hawaiʻi had enjoyed succesful careers as plantation owners, government officials and merchants. However, for years there were talks of annexation among both the white population of Hawaiʻi and United States government. The call to annexation were because of five main reasons: the decline of the Native population, Hawaiʻi's economic and military significance, fear of other countries taking Hawaiʻi for themselves and manifest destiny</p>
        <h2>Low Population of Hawaiians</h2>
        <p>By 1866, There was around 60,000 Native Hawaiians left. Just sixteen years earlier, there was 85,000. Americans believed that the Hawaiian race would die out within one or two generations. With so few Hawaiian then, why should they continue to rule? U.S Minister James McBryde stated "that within a short period, say from 20-40years, there will not be enough of them remaining to perpetuate this government. This being the case, these islands must, out of neccssity, pass into other hands and their destiny controlled by other people."</p>
        <h2>Military Significance</h2>
        <p>Hawaiʻi was in a perfect position in the Pacific to place a naval base. </p> 
        <h1>The Hawaiian League take action</h1>
        <p>In reaction to Kalākaua's attempt to establish a Polynesian empire and his lavish spending habits, the secret Hawaiian League was created. The goal of this all-white League was to create a constituational republic made up of themselves. They felt the king's power was absolute, and that he needed to be dethroned. However, they did not want to establish a new constitution for the betterment of the citizens of Hawaiʻi, but to give Caucasians more rights and restrict Native Hawaiian's political rights. </p>

        <p>The Hawaiian League soon allied themselves with an all-Caucasian para-military organization called the Honolulu Rifles. By July 6, Hawaiian League founder Lorrin Thurston had wrote up a new constitution, which would be forced upon Kalākaua with the threat of the Honolulu Rifles.</p>
        <h1>The Bayonet Constitution of 1887</h1>
        <p>On the morning of July 6th, Honolulu Rifle leader Colonel Volney Ashford attacked and seized a shipment of arms and marched with a squad of Honolulu Rifles to Hawaiʻi Prime Minsister Walter M. Gibson's home, arresting and threatening to kill him. Kalākaua soon caught wind of the Honolulu Rifles, who then approached him with Thurston's constitution. After asking for advice from (ENTER), Kalākaua signed the constitution after a few hours of arguing. A new Cabinet was soon appointed, that being made up of five Hawaiian League members. Because of the threats of violence the king was under, the Constitution of 1887 soon became known as the Bayonet Constitution</p>

        <p>The Bayonet Constitution included major changes to Hawaiʻi government, the largest of which was greatly restricting the monarch's power. The King could no longer act without approval of the Cabinet, and the Cabinet could only be changed by the Legislature. Another major shift was in that of voting regulations. Property and income requirements increased significantly, and all Asia-born citizens were excluded from voting. The new requirements shifted voting power towards the white men of Hawaiʻi, since most Native Hawaiians did not have the amount of income or land the new Constitution deemed necessary. It also completely excluded almost all of the immigrants from voting, except for the Portugese, who allowed to vote under the Constitution's rules.</p>

                <p>King Kalākaua was virtually disposed as a monarch, holding almost zero power in the Hawaiian government. The revolution was a complete success, and foreigner's now controlled Hawaiʻi's government. The new Constitution was extremely disliked by the Native Hawaiians, who would send resolutions asking for a return to the previous constitution. In 1899, two years after the Bayonet Constitution, an insurrection was attempted. Led by the aliʻi Robert Wilcox, a hundred insurrectionists occupied the ʻIolani Palace's grounds. It was soon crushed by American soldiers, who were able to help stop a violent insurrection by Hawaiians, but not from white people. The writing on the wall was clear: Hawaiʻi's government was no longer in the hands of Hawaiians.</p>

        <p>Kalākaua died on January 30th, 1891. He was a king that always pushed for the advancement of Hawaiʻi and it's people while still retaining it's own culture. While seen as extravagant and even cowardly at the time, Kalākaua is now appreciated today for his </p>
