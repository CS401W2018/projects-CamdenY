        <h2>Further Reading/Research</h2>
        <p>Want a more in-depth explanation of the Hawaiian Kingdom without reading something? Try watching an Act of War <a href="https://vimeo.com/121974910">here.</a></p>

        <p>The majority of the research I did for this site came from Rich Budnick's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1763688.Stolen_Kingdom">Stolen Kingdom: An American Conspiracy</a>, a very well written book that goes into detail about all the events that led up to the Overthrow. I'd reccomend it for anyone that want's to learn about the Overthrow for the first time.</p>
        <p>Another book I reccommend is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Annexation-Hawaii-Fighting-American-Imperialism/dp/0963348418">Annexation Hawaii: Fighting American Imperialism </a> by Thomas Osborne. It goes into depth about the fallout of the Provisional Government's takeover and how the U.S Senate argued about annexation for years.</p>
        <p>The last one I would reccommend is Jonathan Kamakawiwoʻole Osorio's <a href="https://uhpress.hawaii.edu/title/dismembering-lahui-a-history-of-the-hawaiian-nation-to-1887/">Dismembering Lahui: A history of the Hawaiian Nation to 1887.</a>I know I used a quote in the book to end my last page, but this book is really special. It explains how Western influence didn't just change the government of Hawaiʻi, but the people and how it created a struggle for Hawaiian personal identity that continues into the modern era. It's a great read, I highly reccomend it.</p>
