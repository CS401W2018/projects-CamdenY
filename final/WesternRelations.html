        <h1>The First Contact</h1>
        <p>The first recorded European contact to the Hawaiian islands happened in 1779, when English explorer Captain Cook landed on Hawaiʻi island. He made contact with the native's there, who he saw as a thriving and healthy people. Cook described the Hawaiians as having a "keen, intelligent dispositon" and being "vigorous, active, and most active swimmers." While some estimate that the Hawaiian population at the time at was 200,000, others put the population at a massive 1,000,000.</p>

        <p>Although Captain Cook was killed after returning a second time to the islands, his ship's visit to Hawaiʻi changed everything. The biggest effect was smallpox from the British sailors, which soon infected the Native Hawaiian population, killing thousands. A less immediate effect was the influence the foreigners arrival had on a young chief from the island of Hawaiʻi named Kamehameha, who would soon begin a quest to unite all the islands of Hawaiʻi.</p>

        <p>Kamehameha's conquest in the Hawaiian islands became much easier with the assistance of two western advisors, John Young and Isaac Davis and the acquirement of muskets, gunpowder and cannons. By 1794, Kamehameha had fought his last battle on his quest, annhilating Oahu's chief mōʻi Kalanikūpule's forces with spears backed by gun and cannonfire. By 1810, Kauaʻi and Niʻihau were surrendered to Kamehameha, making him the first king over all the islands.</p>
        <h2>Liholiho: Ending the Kapu System and the Introduction of Christianity.</h2>
        <p>When Kamehameha I died in 1819, his highest ranking son Liholiho became ruler. Being the son of two extremely high ranking aliʻi (Kamehameha and Keōpulani), Liholiho's mana (or power) was even higher than that of his parents. Because of this, he was manipulated by the Kuhina Nui (regent) Kaʻahumanu and his mother Keōpulani to break the ʻai kapu, effectively ending the legitmacy of the Hawaiian religion. With the Hawaiian religion being broken, the conditions were perfect for a new religion to establish itself in the islands.</p>

        <p>Protestant missionaries soon arrived in 1820. The missionaries viewed the the Hawaiian people as profane and hedonestic. Asa Thurston, leader of the missionaries  With the help of Kaʻahumanu, Christian laws were soon set in place that restricted much of native culture. Although many native Hawaiians accepted Christiananity due to it's promise of an afterlife in a time where thousands were dying, they needed to give up much of what made them who they were. Hawai</p>
