        <p>Kalākaua became king after winning the 1874 election following the previous king Lunalilo's death. He was the first king seperate from the Kamehameha lineage, and his reign focused a lot on restoring Hawaiian culture and establishing Hawaiʻi as a legitimate nation, much to the dismay of the white population at the time. In 1881, Kalākaua becamme the first monarch to circumnavigate the globe. The purpose of this journey was to gain convince people to immigrate to Hawaiʻi to help the declining population and serve as workers on sugar plantations. However, many accused Kalākaua seeking to sell his kingdom off.</p>
