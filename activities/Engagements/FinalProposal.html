        <h2>The title and topic of your site.</h2>
        <p>The title of my topic will be "A History of the Hawaiian Overthrow."</p>
        <h2>A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</h2>
        <p>For my Hawaiian Studies class we needed to make a project on a Hawaiian subject. I chose the history of the Overthrow because I previously had a lot of knowledge on it.</p>
        <h2>List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).</h2>
        <p>I'll have a home page with a quick summary of what the site is about and how it is important. Then I'll make the following five sections.</p>
        <li>
            <ul><i>Precontexteual Foreign Relations</i></ul>
            <ul><i>King Kalākaua</i></ul>
            <ul><i>The Bayonet Constitution</i></ul>
            <ul><i>Liliʻuokalani</i></ul>
            <ul><i>The Overthrow of 1893</i></ul>
        </li>
        <h2>What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?</h2>
        <p>I will collect information about the history of this event, especially the words of the people who overtook the Kingdom and the words of Queen Liliʻuokalani herself. For the table, I'll catalogue the decling Native Hawaiian population throughout the 1800's.</p>
        <h2>How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</h2>
        <p>I already have a bibliography of 11 books <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YrTEyLRMGOzWr6NhQRIS8jkfC4FIiNJegIUTLky79ds/edit?tab=t.0">here</a>.</p>
        <h2>Include a statement acknowledging that you have read the warnings below.
        </h2>
        <p>I have read the warnings.</p>
