        <h1>Queen Liliʻuokalani: The Last Mōʻi of Hawaiʻi.</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"For many years our sovereigns had welcomed the advice of, and given full representations in their government and councils to, American residents who had cast in their lot with our people, and established industries on the Islands. As they became wealthy, and acquired titles to lands through the simplicity of our people and their ignorance of values and of the new land laws, their greed and their love of power proportionately increased; and schemes for aggrandizing themselves still further, or for avoiding the obligations which they had incurred to us, began to occupy their minds. So the mercantile element, as embodied in the Chamber of Commerce, the sugar planters, and the proprietors of the "missionary" stores, formed a distinct political party, called the "down-town" party, whose purpose was to minimize or entirely subvert other interests, and especially the prerogatives of the crown, which, based upon ancient custom and the authority of the island chiefs, were the sole guaranty of our nationality. Although settled among us, and drawing their wealth from our resources, they were alien to us in their customs and ideas respecting government, and desired above all things the extension of their power, and to carry out their own special plans of advancement, and to secure their own personal benefit. It may be true that they really believed us unfit to be trusted to administer the growing wealth of the Islands in a safe and proper way. But if we manifested any incompetency, it was in not foreseeing that they would be bound by no obligations, by honor, or by oath of allegiance, should an opportunity arise for seizing our country, and bringing it under the authority of the United States."</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>Kalākaua's sister Liliʻuokalani was named as his heir preceding his death. A strong-willed and unyielding woman, Liliʻuokalani did not want to rule under the constitution forced upon her brother. Although her reign was short, being only two years, she truly sought to bring Hawaiʻi back into the power of Hawaiians. Liliʻuokalani quickly made plans to uproot the Bayonet Constitution, which would be thwarted by the men who sought to take her kingdom.</p>

        <h2>The McKinley Tariff</h2>
        <p>3 months after Liliʻuokalani reign started, a new tax that overrode the Reciprocity Treaty was created. The McKinley Tariff raised the taxes on Hawaiian sugar brought into the U.S, sending the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi into an economic spiral. Due to this economic pressure, Pearl Harbor needed to be turned over to America to draw Hawaiʻi out of economic depression.</p>
        <h2>Annexation Club is Born</h2>
        <p>The Annexation Club was soon founded in 1982 and composed of several previous members of the Reform Party. While the Reform Party had accomplished their goal, this new Annexation Club was even smaller, holding just 17 members and pursuing a new goal: To completely destroy the monarchy annex Hawaiʻi for the United States.</p>

        <p>Lorrin Thurston led the group again, as he was in close contact with many U.S politicians. He spoke to James Blaine, the U.S Secretary of State, and Secretary of Navy Benjamin Tracy about the increasing probability of annexation. Thurston suggested that if the Queen ever dared to step out of line and promulgate a new constution that they would move out and attempt annexation to the U.S. After speaking with President Harrison, Tracy delivered encouraging news. "-you will find and exceedingly sympathetic administration here." <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1763688.Stolen_Kingdom">(Budnick, 95)</a></p>
        <p>Meanwhile, U.S minister to Hawaiʻi John Stevens plotted his own annexation. For years he believed Hawaiʻi needed to be taken by the U.S or risk losing it forever. He planned to either buy Hawaiʻi for $100,000, or annex the islands through "bold and vigorous measures." <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1763688.Stolen_Kingdom">(Budnick, 91)</a></p>

        <h2>Hawaiians Seek Change</h2>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, the people of Hawaiʻi had not been complacent in the taking of their kingdom. They formed new political parties, such as the Liberal Party, which sought to completely remove the monarchy and establish a republic run by Native Hawaiians. While not every Hawaiian wanted such radical change, almost all of them did want one thing: to revert or remove the Bayonet Constitution that oppressed them. Petitions were signed by two-thirds of the registered voters for a new constitution. Liliʻuokalani knew the will of the people, and she drafted a new constitution. This constitution would've given the monarchy much of it's power back, given Native Hawaiians the right to vote for Representatives and removed most of the propety qualifications that prevented Hawaiians from voting for the House of Nobles. This constitution, which Liliʻuokalani wrote to benefit her people, would be further justification for the actions the Annexation Club and U.S military would soon take.</p>
