        <h1>King Kalākaua</h1>
        <p>Kalākaua became king after winning the 1874 election following the previous king Lunalilo's death. He was the first king seperate from the Kamehameha lineage, and his reign focused a lot on restoring Hawaiian culture and establishing Hawaiʻi as a legitimate nation, much to the dismay of the white population at the time. Kalākaua won the election due to the support he had from the sugar growers, who needed him to obtain a new reciprocity treaty from the United States. The treaty was obtained in 1874, but also increased Hawaiʻi's ties to the United States, shutting out any other potential alliances.</p>

        <p>In 1881, Kalākaua becamme the first monarch to circumnavigate the globe. The purpose of this journey was to gain convince people to immigrate to Hawaiʻi to help the declining population and serve as workers on sugar plantations. However, many accused Kalākaua seeking to sell his kingdom off. U.S Secretary of State James Blaine, who was one of the biggest pushers for Hawaiʻi's annexation, was very worried about a land sale to European powers, and recommended that U.S diplomats observe the king's actions and scare off any potential buyers.</p>
        <p>Kalākaua's push for Hawaiʻi's legitmacy and Hawaiian culture angered many. One of these decisions was the inclusion of hula at Kalākaua's public coronation, which had been banned by the first missionaries in Hawaiʻi over 50 years ago. The inclusion angered many children of the first missionaries, accusing Kalākaua of blasphemy. Another was the construction of ʻIolani Palace, a very costly effort that the sugar planters saw as wasteful and extravagant.</p>

        <p>More trouble came when Kalākaua's advisor Walter M. Gibson suggested to him to offer the same tax-free benefits the U.S had to European nations, who could protect Hawaiʻi's independence. He also suggested establishing a Polynesian empire, which Hawaiʻi would be the center of. When Kalākaua sent a delegation to Samoa, Germany became extremely upset, as they were trying to colonize them. They sent angry letters to Washington, who soon asked Kalākaua to stop making the world powers angry. Tensions were high between Kalākaua and the white foreigners of Hawaiʻi, which soon resulted in the formation of a new group aiming to dispose of the king. </p>
